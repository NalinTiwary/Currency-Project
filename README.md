# Currency Project
This project aims to look at the correlation between the relative value of a currency and trade value between those countries. Looking at the data and after discussing the context I decided on the following Null Hypothesis:
H0: There is no significant relationship between the relative value of a currency and the trade value between those countries.
H1: There is a significant relationship between the relative value of a currency and the trade value between those countries.
